### Hi, I'm Wylie! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student at UC Santa Barbara and I'm in the first ever Masters of Environmental Data Science program! I'm learning to apply my biology background to a new set of data science skills that I am currently working on.

I'm currently learning R and python, as well as much much more!

Fun fact: I've lived in Washington State my whole life so I'm also learning how to adapt into the California lifestyle by doing things like surfing and not wearing raincoats.
