### Hi, I'm Wylie! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a graduate student at the Bren School of Environmental Science and Management at UC Santa Barbara, and I am a part of their inaugural Masters of Environmental Data Science program! I'm learning to apply my biology background to a new set of data science skills in order to work towards solving the many environemtal problems that I feel so passionatly about.

Throughout my program I've learned to see data in a completely new way and it has been so exciting to learn how to work with this data in order to reveal what wasn't seen before.

Fun fact: I've lived in Washington State my whole life so I'm also learning how to adapt into the California lifestyle by doing things like surfing and not wearing raincoats.

For more information about me and some things that I've worked on, check out my personal website here: https://wyliehampson.github.io/
